Null Safety

Var f:String = null
This is wrong bcoz we are assigning a null type to a non-null type
Instead:
Var f:String? = null
? - makes sure that no NullPointerException is occurred at compiletime

For finding size:
var size:INT = f ? length ? : 0
If f==null
Then f.length = 0
         then
                f.length = jo bhi string ki length hai
