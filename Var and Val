Var and val are two keywords used in kotlin


Var - is mutable and global i.e it can be changed multiple times 
Val - is immutable i.e is final and cannot be changed

Now you cannot use these as global variables with only defination
Like
Var a:String
Val b:String   //you cannot initilize val b afterwards do it here only
(This will not work)

But,
lateinit var a:String   //late Initilization and initilize it afterwards in main

Val g:String = "Sehaj" // This will work
