Maps in Kotlin

Val mapList = mapOf("Name" to "Sehaj", 2017 to 2019 , "Birthday" to 1998)
mapList.set() will not work bcoz map is immutable

For adding items to map use HashMap

Val HashMapList = hashMapOf("Name" to "Sehaj", 2017 to 2019 , "Birthday" to 1998)
HashMapList.set("Class" to "Btech") will work bcoz map is mutable i.e we can add items explicitly
                           
                             OR
HashMapList["Collge"] = "Thapar"
