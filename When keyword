When as a replacement for Switch

 val num : Int = 2

//When you need to return something
 var x = When(num)
{
    1 -> "One"
    2 -> "Two"
    3 -> "Three"
    else -> "No num"
}
 println("Str is $x)

//When you want to print like this
When(num)
{
    1 -> println("One")
    2 -> prinln("Two")
    3 -> "Three"
    else -> "No num"
