Loops in Kotlin


All loops while , do, for works in kotlin
Difference b/w while and for is that in while we donâ€™t know how many elements are there like in a file which contains text

But in kotlin a forEach loop exists

For hashMap
hashMapofNames.forEach{any , any2 -> 
      println(" " + any + any2)
      }
  any ---> key
  any2 -->value

For mutableList

mutableList.forEach{ 
       println(it)          
}

For Any Generic List    //any list of int or string

nameString.forEach{ 
       println(it)          
}
